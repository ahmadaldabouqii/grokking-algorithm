1. Suppose you have a list of 128 names, and you're searching through it using binary search. What's the maximum number of steps it would take?

> The maximum number of steps it would take to find a name in a list of 128 names would be `log_2(128)` or `7` steps:

2. Suppose you double the size of the list. What's the maximum number of steps now?

> If you double the size of the list to 256 name, the maximum number of steps it would take to find a name in the list would be `log_2(256)` or `8`.

```
> log_2(128) = x
> 2^x = 128
> 2^x = 2^7
> x = 7
```
